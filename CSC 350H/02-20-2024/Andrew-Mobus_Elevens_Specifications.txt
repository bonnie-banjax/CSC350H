System Description & Requirements

-->  General System Description Requirements:
-> the total game set is 52 cards; four sets of values [1-10 + J, Q, K]
-> the table set is exactly 9 cards, except while processing a move
-> the table set cards are the only visable cards; the deck values are hidden
-> valid pairings are two cards that add to exactly 11, and one exception
-> the exception case is a unordered triad made of exactly one jack, one queen, one king
-> the suit of cards in not relevant for the game and can be entirely ignored
-> the game is over when there are no more legal pairs (or the triad case) on the table set
-> if the deck and table set are empty when the game ends, it is a win, otherwise, it is a loss
-> there is no draw condition; a game is either a win, or a loss
-> when a valid pair or the valid triad are picked, they are removed from the table set
-> selecting a valid pair or triad is the only way cards can be removed from the table set
-> whenever cards are removed from the table set, and equal number are drawn from the deck
and added to the table set
-> the discard pile isn't used in any capacity
-> there is no way moves can be undone
-> the system is deterministic and based entirely on the card order after shuffling
-> there is no means of interacting with the deck other than drawing cards to replace cards
removed via picking a valid pair or triad

--> System Requirements
-> detect valid pairings when presented as input
-> ignore invalid input & notify user that the input was invalid
-> process move submissions as valid or invalid
-> process valid moves by removing the input set from the table set
-> replace removed elements from table set with elements from deck set
-> process table state to determine if any legal moves exists
-> on detection that no legal moves exists, determine whether the state is a win or loss
-> notify the user when the game is won or lost
-> a shuffle / restart action the user can select at any time to make a new game
-> the only user input during a game is the section of cards from the table set
-> display the values of the table set
-> display the remaining number of cards in the deck
