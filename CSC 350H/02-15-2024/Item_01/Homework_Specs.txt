1.) Implement selection sort method & test the method
2.) implement the Card & Deck classes (shuffle, cut, draw) (tests) (print)
3.) Implement a class called BankAccount.

--> Also the Logs from previous bit!
-> zip all files together

--> tuesday we discuss how to shuffle

--> Need to improve test development for lab programs
-> come up with automatic tests
-> think of more test cases for any class & program
-> include as many meaningful test cases

-> empty list
-> single element list
-> sorted list
-> reverse sorted list
-> a list with repeated elements

--> Cut deck of cards at given location
-> remove all cards before the given index & add to back

Test code if each card is moved to a different location


1: create Dictionary of all cards with integer key values from 0 to total cards
2: create a simple array of integers 


note: ignore valid card location (?) requirement

deal card

remove card
