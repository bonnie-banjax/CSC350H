I apologize for both the lateness of the assignment and it's disarray;
I'm trying to deal with the transfer process for the fall and some unknown
hold ups in the process. My implementation of the assignment is not particular
in the the spirit of TTD; I adjusted a bunch of the base code in ways I would
not do were it production release (like changing whether something was public
or private). This is due in part because my code doesn't seem to be in the 
state were I left it; I've been trying to refactor & generalize the code in
a seperate project (you may see traces of that from before I seperated them,
such as "player" being called "Agent") and I may have inadvertently wrecked
or otherwise scrambled code I didn't mean to in the process. I recognize the
approach isn't tenable, and will fully address it before the console project
of "Elevens" is due. A result of this will be that some of the naming
conventions for that project, and its internal code, will differ quite a lot
from the code presented here, as will any associated tests & respective code

// [PREFACE]:
// while these tests meet the word of the assignment, they are not not in the spirit
// I had to fiddle with a lot of the base code, which was already not in the state
// I thought I left it after finishing the initial test lab; I'm currently working
// to overhaul & refactor all the classes to be more robust going forward, ie
// for use in the upcoming Elevens assignment
